Thank you for choosing `auto-dark`
----------------------------------

Automatically switch Sublime Color Schemes with your operating system's appearance:

* when switching tabs within or switching to Sublime
* or every 5 mins (on the clock)

`auto-dark` will copy:

* `color_scheme.light`
* or `color_scheme.dark`

to `color_scheme` in `Preferences.sublime-settings` at that time.
You can use the resource name instead of its full (local) resource path.
