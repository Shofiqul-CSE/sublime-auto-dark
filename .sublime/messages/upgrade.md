Thank you for upgrading `auto-dark` to `v3.1.1` (2020-05-03)
------------------------------------------------------------

`auto-dark` made adjustments for ST4074 and `mdpopups` v3.7.0.

Please manually run:

    `PackageControl: Satisfy Dependencies`

from the Command Palette to update mdpopups to v3.7.0 or later.

There is still a known issue with auto-changing appearances on Catalina:

This will be fixed hopefully soon.

Please restart Sublime Text manually after clearing its cache.
